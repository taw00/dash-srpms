# Dash Core for Fedora Linux<br />_...wallet, node, and masternode_

**Important notices:**
* For both Dash Core and Dash Masternode Tool (DMT), I no longer supply packages for RHEL/CentOS.
* For Dash Core, use the provided systemd configuration. This makes nodes near bullet-proof, even on Fedora.
* Dash Masternode Tool: DMT will remain Fedora-only! except for test builds.
* Dash Core 0.15 was released on Feb 19, 2020.
* Keep up with Fedora's release schedule: <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases>

Fedora upgrades are easy (see available documentation in the "documentation"
folder). Legacy comment: RHEL/CentOS to Fedora or newer RHEL/CentOS should be
performed as fresh installs.

**Dash (Digital Cash)** is an open source peer-to-peer cryptocurrency with an
emphasis on serving as an efficient platform for payments and decentralized
applications. Dash offers a form of money that is portable, inexpensive,
divisible and fast. It can be spent securely both online and in person with
minimal transaction fees. Dash offers instant transactions **(InstantSend)**,
private / more-fungible transactions **(PrivateSend)**, and operates a
self-governing and self-funding model. This decentralized governance and
budgeting system makes it the first ever successful decentralized autonomous
organization (DAO).

Dash is open source and the name of the overarching project. Learn more

This github repository is used to develop and maintain Dash natively built
and packaged for Fedora Linux.

The source packages are housed directly within this repository. For more about
the source packages and build instructions, please visit this link:
<https://github.com/taw00/dashcore-rpm/blob/master/README.source.md>

## Binary (executable) RPMs

**Binary (executable) RPMs are pre-built for you (from these sources) and are
available through external repositories that your packaging system can
understand.** This makes deploying and maintaining Dash on a Fedora, CentOS, or
RHEL system dependable, more secure, and oh so very simple. This is arguably
the simplest way to deploy and manage a Dash Wallet, Node, or Masternode. For
more about the available binary RPMs, please visit this link:

### Disclaimer!

These packages have been successfully built and tested, but I lay no claim that
they are absolutely free of any bugs in the code, default configuration,
documented configuration, or in the builds or how those builds are
deployed/installed.

These packages have been used by myself and others for years at this point, but
in the end, users must assume the risks associated to both community built and
deployed packages and, of course, any cryptocurrency funds managed by this
software. I.e., These will probably work for you, but I can't be liable for any
loss of funds or damages associated to this software.
