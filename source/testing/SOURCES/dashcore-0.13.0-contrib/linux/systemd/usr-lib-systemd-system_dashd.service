Description=Dash Core Daemon
After=syslog.target network-online.target

# Notes:
# Do not edit this file. Instead edit /etc/sysconfig/dashd
# ...unless you ever duplicate this service (run multiple-nodes on one
# machine). In that case you need to rename this and deal with the pid file
# changes
#
# Watch the daemon service actions in the syslog journal with:
# sudo journalctl -u dashd.service -f

# Make dashd less likely to be killed when RAM is low
# (-1000 == will not be killed; 1000 == first to die)

# If ExecStop is not set, systemd sends a SIGTERM, which is "okay", just not
# ideal. So, let's send a stop instead.
ExecStop=/usr/bin/dash-cli -conf=${CONFIG_FILE} -datadir=${DATA_DIR} stop

# In this interval of time, we allow systemd to start dashd "burst" number
# of times. With Dash we really only want one instance started, so... let's
# really limit this. But we want to give systemd some room to attempt to
# correct things. To be honest, I think the way things are configured between
# these settings and TimeoutStartSec, only one instance will be initiated.
