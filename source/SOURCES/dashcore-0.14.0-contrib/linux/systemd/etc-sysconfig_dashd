# Configuration settings leveraged by the systemd-managed dashd.service

# EMAIL_FROM, EMAIL_TO, MASTERNODE_ALIAS
# Send email upon start, stop, and restart of the dashd.service
#
# If these values are set, emails will be sent "from" EMAIL_FROM, "to" EMAIL_TO,
# and with MASTERNODE_ALIAS as a subject line differentiator.
# Therefore, edit these settings as appropriate for your circumstance.
#
# NOTE:
# To function without error, your system MUST be configured to be able to send
# email successfully using these settings. Configuring your system to be able
# to email is left as an exercise to the reader of this comment. You can test
# if your system is appropriately configured with a simple...
#
# echo "body" | mail -s "test subject" -r your_from@example.com your_to@example.com
#
# You may have to issue an systemctl daemon-reload for these changes to take
# effect.
