# HowTo: Deploy and Configure a Fedora Linux Operating System
***...to serve as a platform for a Dash Core Node or Masternode***

Note: Linked-to are instruction for deploying a base- or minimal- system. No dash
related configurations are made here. We describe those elsewhere. For example,
a Node or Masternode listening on the network will require solid FirewallD
configuration. This document will describe general purpose firewall
configuration and the masternode deployment documents will describe how to add
Dash specific firewall configuration.

> A note about minimum requirements. Masternodes are no longer "glorified full

> This will increase over time. 4G RAM is not a bad idea either.

Are you ready? If so, follow the deployment instructions found here:
<https://github.com/taw00/howto/blob/master/howto-deploy-and-configure-a-minimalistic-fedora-linux-server.md>

If all went well, you have an efficient, working, and secure system prepared to
run a Dash Core Node or Masternode, or really any workload. I hope this was
helpful.
